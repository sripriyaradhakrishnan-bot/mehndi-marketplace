TL;DR

Sprint 1 (Aug 18–31, Coimbatore): ship PWA booking with refundable deposit (Razorpay escrow), live availability, and analytics.

Targets by Aug 31: 3,000 sessions → 450 inquiries → 120 deposits → 85+ completions; deposit success ≥95%, p95 booking < 2.0s, Ops FRT ≤15m / ART ≤4h.

Supply: 60 verified vendors live (mehndi + adjacent), median vendor reply ≤10m.

Go-to-Market: Google Search + IG Lead Ads with strict UTMs; CRM nudges (ack → nudge → T-2d → day-of → review).

Top 5 P1 tickets below (checkout+webhooks, calendar/reschedule, price card + refund copy, analytics+A/B, reconciler+payout stub).

Key risks: payment webhooks, lead quality, KYC lag, mobile perf on mid-range Android, moderation. Mitigations attached.

Definition of Done (Sprint): live deposits + refunds working end-to-end, dashboards reading events, first partner payouts queued.
